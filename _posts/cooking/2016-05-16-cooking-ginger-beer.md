## Phase One - Ginger Beer Bug

## Phase Two - Flavour Base

### Ratios

* 1L tap water
* 1L pre-boiled water
* 1 - 3 inches of grated ginger
* 0.5 - 0.75 cups raw sugar
* 1 lemon

### Process
1. Bring 2L of water to the boil
2. Add ginger
3. Add raw sugar
4. Boil for 15 - 20 minutes
5. Wait for mixture to cool

## Phase Three - Bottling

### Preparation
Clean bottles to ensure no other microbes are present in the bottles. Sodium Metabisulphite or other disinfectant is a good choice

### Process
1. Add 1L (ratio) of preboiled water
2. Add Ginger Beer Bug to mix
3. Strain mixture in to bottles. Fill until the bottle starts curving up to the neck - this ensures you can open them later
