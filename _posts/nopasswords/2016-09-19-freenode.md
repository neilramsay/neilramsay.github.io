## Freenode NickServ Authentication


## 

## Testing
Once connected to Freenode, perform a whois lookup on your IRC nickname.
To do this, type `/whois nickname`, where `nickname` is yours.

If your client authentication succeeded you should see something similar to this:
```
ircname  : AgentNoel
channels : ...
server   : adams.freenode.net [Budapest, HU, EU]
         : is using a secure connection
         : has client certificate fingerprint 7dcba329fcc5d452d8778e5c1e3df44d0342d59f
hostname : blackhole.agentnoel.geek.nz 127.0.0.1
idle     : 0 days 0 hours 25 mins 5 secs [signon: Mon Sep 19 12:23:28 2016]
account  : agentnoel
```

The key lines are:
* account - this is your Freenode IRC nickname, and confirms nickserv has authenticated you
* server - shows you using a secure connection, and provided a client certificate
